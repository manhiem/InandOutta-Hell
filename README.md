# InandOutta-Hell
A 2D Unity Platformer built using Finite State Machine (still under development)

## Current Progress Update
Right now, I've got the Enemy AI and Player Movement all powered by the incredible FSM, and let me tell you, it's like magic! 🧙‍♂️ Not to mention, I've created a temporary 
level that's so much fun to play (thanks, Itch.io, for the amazing content 🔥🔥🔥).

Here are some of the game development gems I've picked up along the way:
-> Finite State Manager (FSM): This game-changer brings order and control to the chaos of game states. With seamless transitions and dynamic gameplay, FSM is my secret weapon!

-> Object Pooling: Efficiency at its finest! By reusing objects, I've optimized memory usage, ensuring players enjoy a buttery-smooth gaming experience without any hiccups.

-> Blend Trees and Sub-States: Animation magic in action! My characters and enemies come to life with fluid animations, adding that extra touch of realism that makes the game pop!

I can't wait to share the full version of the game, complete with GitHub and itch.io playable links, in the upcoming days. Stay tuned for an adventure you won't want to miss! 🚀💫
